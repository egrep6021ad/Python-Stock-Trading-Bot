# Python-Stock-Trading-Bot
### This is a personal project to predict prices of stocks before buying and selling via real time data using python. This project is still in development but it mines data using the TD Ameritrade API before passing said data through a tensor flow LSTM model, harnessing the power of machine learning. Antwon makes predictions on 85% of 5 years of training data. Then, uses the remaining 15% to validate predictions. All data is relevant and the last prediction was for the current date the image was uploaded.
