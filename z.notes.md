# Notes

## Strats:
### Quantitative Value:
Pick by lowest P/E
### Momentum 

## Bear Put Spread (vertical):
BUY (short) put option at strike price X.
SELL (write) (long) put option at strike price < X (
Same Asset 
Same Expiration 

Profit Cap realized when: 
stock price < strike price of the short put (lower strike)

Loss Limited:
if the stock price > strike price of of the long put (higher strike).

### Profit:
strike price (high) - strike price(low)  = difference between strike prices
diff_between strike - (cost of option 1 - cost of option 2)
Strike A = 100 , premium = 3.20
Strike B = 95, premium = 1.30
100 - 95 = 5
5 - (3.20 - 1.30) 
5 - 1.90 = 

3.10 = max profit

## Risk:
This happens when the stock > strike of long put
Strike A = 100 , premium = 3.20
Strike B = 95, premium = 1.30
Stock = 104
3.20 lost on stock A.
1.30 won on stock B. 

1.90 = net difference = max loss 


## Selling Contract
Remember
## Analysis:
If stock goes higher than the long put and it loses, you still win the sell of the short put. This caps loss at the net difference between the two 


Example on TWTR:
Buy strike A = 46.5, premium 2.82
Sell strike B = 43.5, premium = .77

(46.5 - 43.5) - (2.82 - .77) = 
3 - 2.05 = .95 max profit 

stock > long 
stock > 46.5
2.82 loss
.77 win 
2.05 max loss 

Risk: 2.05 v Reward .95
